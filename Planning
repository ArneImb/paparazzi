Meeting 02/03
DRONE ID: TUBBC32

Work breakdown structure:
1. Vison obstacle avoidance
  a) Look into monocular avoidance strategies
    i) Detecting objects
      - Research methods
      - Bearing
      - 
    ii) Estimate distance
      - Research methods
      
    iii) Flight path strategy
    
        - Look around for a longest straight path from a position
        - Minimize time standing in one place
        - Check twice if a path is ok

2. Localization
  - Initially try with optitrack, use onboard if time permits
 
3. Writing a report
  
Planning:
  Week 3:
    - Gather data from bebop cameras
    - Create folder on github for python
    - Look into available modules for BEBOP
    - Play around with orange avoidance module
    - Play around with openCV in python
    - Practice with GAZEBO
  Week 4:
    - Object detection implemented in the drone if possible with depth estimation
  Week 5:
    - Definitely finished with object detection and depth estimation
    - Given data from vision generate paths
  Week 6:
    - Back up time
  Week 7:
    - Definitely finished
